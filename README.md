# Abstract

A simple demo that shows how to use OpenCV with EGE.

## Build

Only 32 bit prebuilt OpenCV binaries provided.
So you can do like this:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake.exe .. -A win32
```

You can also use your own version of OpenCV if you want to build the x64 version of the demo.
